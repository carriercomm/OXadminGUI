Peter’s OX Server Admin GUI
===========================

This is a fork of [Peter’s OX Server Admin GUI](OXadminGUI) version [0.1.17] to fix an issue when utilized with grizzly [1].

The Netbeans project files are not included since I did not get it to compile. Instead I included a new build.xml.


Build
-----

 ```
 ant dist
 ```
